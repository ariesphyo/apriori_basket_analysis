**Market Basket Analysis** 

Market basket analysis is an effective analysis of the implementation of cross-selling strategies. 
This analysis is crucial in retailing to discover customer behaviours in a large basket. 

**Data Explanation** 

The dataset I used for this analysis is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wood0pecker1/apriori/input). There are a total of 522064 rows for two years of data starting from 2010 to 2011. In this analysis, I prepared a basket using only two months of transaction data.
