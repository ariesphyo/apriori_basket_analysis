**Market Basket Analysis** 

Market basket analysis is a powerful analysis of the implementation of cross-selling strategies. 
This analysis is crucial in retailing to discover customer behaviours in a large basket. 

**Data Explanation** 

The dataset I used for this analysis is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wood0pecker1/apriori/input). For this analysis, I prepared a basket using only three months of transaction data starting from January 2010 to February 2011.
